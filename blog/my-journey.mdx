## The beginning 

From an early age, I've always been atracted to the practicalities of software UIs, and curious about programming. Starting as a hobby, I became interested in building full stack apps in 2020.

## Taking courses and personal projects

I learned React and Node by taking courses and applying the knowledge in personal projects. Later in 2021, I built my first mobile app with React Native, and became confident with exploring and implementing new libraries by reading documentation.

## Alkemy.org

Starting 2022, I heard about Alkemy.org, an acceleration program offering apprenticeship to trainees. Determined to take a leap and become a professional software developer, I submitted the admission challenge and was accepted.

Alkemy was a great, valuable experience. Under the leadership and mentorship of a senior MercadoLibre engineer, my team and I built a modern UI for an ONG. Working under a simulated realistic environment, I became familiar with Agile methodologies, its workflow and its tools. During this process, I enjoyed helping the others and saw myself as a team-player. 

Besides, having my code reviewed by an experienced developer significantly improved my code quality.
